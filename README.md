This is a work-in-progress implementation of the [Rockstar](https://github.com/dylanbeattie/rockstar) language.

It transpiles Rockstar code to JavaScript.

Usage:
```
yarn install
yarn build
./rockstar program.rock
node program.js
```

**Note:** Due to the extremely fast speed of updates to Rockstar, this implementation may not always match the current spec. [wolfgang42/rockstar](https://github.com/wolfgang42/rockstar) has the version of this spec targeted by this implementation. View differences between the two here: [wolfgang42/master...dylanbeattie/master](https://github.com/wolfgang42/rockstar/compare/master...dylanbeattie:master]

Also, since this is a WIP not all of Rockstar works properly yet.

Contributions welcome!
